# Culinary Course Selector

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help users explore and select culinary courses. The application provides an interactive interface for browsing culinary education paths and maintaining a favorites list. It functions as a course catalog or selection tool, suitable for culinary schools, educational platforms, or career guidance systems in the food and hospitality industry.

**Latest Update (October 28, 2025)**: The application now features a modern dark purple/black theme with fully responsive design supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit - Python-based web framework chosen for rapid application development and ease of use
- **Layout**: Wide layout mode (`layout="wide"`) for optimal content presentation
- **State Management**: Streamlit's `session_state` for tracking user selections and favorites during active sessions
- **UI Components**: Course data presented with emoji icons for visual appeal and cross-platform compatibility
- **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries support three breakpoints:
  - Desktop: > 768px (full featured layout)
  - Tablet: ≤ 768px (optimized spacing and typography)
  - Mobile: ≤ 480px (single column, touch-friendly controls)

**Design Rationale**: Streamlit eliminates the need for JavaScript knowledge, allowing Python developers to quickly build interactive web interfaces. The framework handles routing, state management, and UI rendering automatically, accelerating development time.

### UI/UX Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Modern dark theme with purple accents
  - Primary gradient: `#2D1B4E` to `#1a0f2e` (dark purple to deep black)
  - Accent color: `#8B5CF6` (vibrant purple for borders and highlights)
  - Text color: `#ffffff` (white for optimal contrast)
  - Button color: `#FF6B35` (orange for call-to-action elements)
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Course cards with hover elevation effects
  - Smooth transitions (0.3s) for all interactive elements
  - Purple glow shadows on hover for visual feedback
- **Accessibility**:
  - Touch-friendly buttons (minimum 48px height on mobile)
  - High contrast text (white on dark backgrounds)
  - Responsive font sizes (0.9rem - 1.5rem based on screen size)

### Backend Architecture
- **Application Entry Point**: `app.py` serves as the main Streamlit application
- **Data Layer**: Hybrid approach combining in-memory session storage with optional PostgreSQL persistence
- **Favorites System**: Dual-storage strategy that gracefully degrades when database is unavailable

**Architectural Decision**: The application implements a resilient favorites system that:
- Attempts to persist data to PostgreSQL when available
- Falls back to session-based storage when database is unavailable
- Warns users once per session about temporary storage limitations
- Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicate entries

**Pros**: Graceful degradation ensures application remains functional even during database outages
**Cons**: Session-based favorites are lost when the browser session ends

### Data Storage
- **Primary Storage**: PostgreSQL database (optional, environment-dependent)
- **Fallback Storage**: Streamlit session_state for temporary persistence
- **Schema**: `favorites` table with columns: `user_id`, `item_type`, `item_name`
- **User Model**: Currently uses a single `default_user` identifier (not multi-user ready)

**Design Decision**: The application checks for `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to determine database availability. This approach allows:
- Deployment flexibility across different environments
- Development without database setup requirements
- Production deployments with persistent storage

**Limitation**: Single-user model (`default_user`) indicates the system is not yet designed for multi-tenancy or user authentication.

### Database Integration
- **Driver**: `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL connectivity
- **Connection Management**: Creates new connection per operation (no connection pooling)
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly warnings
- **Query Pattern**: Direct SQL with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

**Trade-off**: Opening connections per operation is simpler but less efficient than connection pooling. This is acceptable for low-traffic applications but should be optimized for production scale.

## External Dependencies

### Required Python Packages
- **streamlit**: Core web framework for the application interface
- **pandas**: Data manipulation library (imported but usage not visible in provided code)
- **psycopg2**: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Optional relational database for persistent favorites storage
- **Configuration**: Expects `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with connection string
- **Schema Requirements**: Requires `favorites` table with appropriate columns and constraints

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (optional - application runs without it)

### Development Notes
- Application gracefully handles missing database connectivity
- No authentication or user management system currently implemented
- `main.py` appears to be a placeholder and is not actively used
- `attached_assets/` directory contains backup or versioned copies of main files
